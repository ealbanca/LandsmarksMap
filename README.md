# Future Work
* Add a "hover" to the markers when selected. Since the markers are not part of the DOM, they need to be edited or scaled using the Google Maps API.
* Enable users to submit new landmarks through a form, and store those markers in local storage.
* Use the browser's geolocation API to show the userâ€™s current location on the map.
* Integrate local news or event feeds related to Idaho Falls landmarks using APIs or RSS.
