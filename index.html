                <img src=images/idaho.webp alt="Idaho Falls" class="marker-image">
                <p>Located in eastern Idaho along the Snake River, has a rich history rooted in agriculture,
                    transportation, and energy. Originally a crossing point on the Oregon Trail, it began as a small
                    settlement known as Taylor Crossing in the 1860s, named after a ferry operator. The arrival of the
                    Utah and Northern Railroad in 1879 spurred growth, and the town was renamed Idaho Falls in 1891,
                    inspired by the river's rapids. It developed into a regional hub for farming and livestock. In the
                    mid-20th century, the nearby Idaho National Laboratory brought significant scientific and nuclear
                    research activity to the region, making it a center for energy innovation. Today, Idaho Falls is
                    known for its outdoor recreation, proximity to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, and its
                    role in science and technology research.</p>
